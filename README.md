# Home Loan Decision Prediction
## Project description
Using the U.S. HDMA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act), 2017 I am attempting to predict what loan status (Approved, denied by a lender, closed for incompleteness) an individualâ€™s application would get. An individual could benefit by using this model before going to a lender to see if they will be approved. Lenders could use this model as a preliminary check to see if they should approve or deny a loan. With the given dataset I believe a data analytics approach is appropriate because this is a prediction problem that can be solved using details about the customer and lender.

## Install Packages
Install any missing packages mentioned in the requiremets.txt file

## Run Code:
Note: Running the grid search and model training steps takes around 15 hours (on my machine atleast)

1. If the read_csv file location is different change it.
2. Then simply run all lines
